        This document describes an extension to the Interactive
        Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol that enables ICE agents
        to send and receive candidates incrementally rather than
        exchanging complete lists. With such incremental provisioning,
        ICE agents can begin connectivity checks while they are still
        gathering candidates and considerably shorten the time necessary
        for ICE processing to complete. This mechanism is called "trickle 
        ICE".

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>
        The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol
        <xref target="rfc5245bis"/> describes mechanisms for gathering
        candidates, prioritizing them, choosing default ones, exchanging
        them with the remote party, pairing them, and ordering them into
        check lists. Once all of these actions have been completed (and only
        then), the participating agents can begin a phase of connectivity
        checks and eventually select the pair of candidates that will be
        used in a media session.
      </t>
      <t>
        Although the sequence described above has the advantage of being 
        relatively straightforward to implement and debug once deployed, 
        it can also be rather lengthy. 
        Candidate gathering often involves things like querying
        <xref target="RFC5389">STUN</xref> servers, discovering UPnP
        devices, and allocating relayed candidates at
        <xref target="RFC5766">TURN</xref> servers. All of these actions can
        be delayed for a noticeable amount of time; although they can be
        run in parallel, they still need to respect the pacing
        requirements from <xref target="rfc5245bis"/>, which is likely to
        delay them even further. Some or all of these actions also
        need be completed by the remote agent. Both agents would
        next perform connectivity checks and only then would they be
        ready to begin streaming media.
      </t>
      <t>
        These factors can lead to relatively lengthy session
        establishment times and degraded user experience.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document defines an alternative mode of
        operation for ICE implementations, known as "Trickle ICE",
        in which candidates can be exchanged incrementally. This enables
        ICE agents to exchange candidates as soon as a
        session has been initiated. Connectivity checks for a media
        stream can also start as soon as the first candidates for that
        stream become available.
      </t>
      <t>
        Trickle ICE can reduce session establishment times in cases
        where connectivity is confirmed for the first exchanged
        candidates (e.g., where the host candidates for one of the agents
        are directly reachable from the second agent, such as host
        candidates at a media relay). Even when this is
        not the case, running candidate gathering for both agents and
        connectivity checks in parallel can considerably
        shorten ICE processing times.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is worth noting that there is quite a bit of operational 
        experience with the Trickle ICE technique, going back as far as
        2005 (when the XMPP Jingle extension defined a "dribble mode" as
        specified in <xref target="XEP-0176"/>); this document incorporates 
        feedback from those who have implemented and deployed the technique.
      </t>
      <t>
        In addition to the basics of Trickle ICE, this document also
        describes how to discover support for Trickle ICE,
        how regular ICE processing needs to be modified when
        building and updating check lists, and how Trickle ICE
        implementations interoperate with agents that only
        implement so-called "Vanilla ICE" processing as defined in
        <xref target="rfc5245bis"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification does not define the usage of Trickle ICE with any
        specific signalling protocol (however, see 
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice-sip"/> for usage with SIP
        <xref target='RFC3261'/>).
        Similarly, it does not define Trickle ICE in
        terms of the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target='RFC4566'/>
        or the offer/answer model <xref target='RFC3264'/> because 
        the technique can be and already is used in application protocols 
        that are not tied to SDP or to offer/answer semantics.

      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Determining Support for Trickle ICE' anchor="disco">
      <t>
        Application protocols that use Trickle ICE should do one of
        the following:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            Provide a way for agents to verify support of Trickle ICE
            prior to initiating a session (XMPP's
            <xref target="XEP-0030">Service Discovery</xref> is 
            one such mechanism).
          </t>
          <t>
            Make support for Trickle ICE mandatory so that user agents
            can assume support.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Alternately, for cases where a protocol provides neither of the
        foregoing methods, agents may rely on provisioning/configuration or
        use the half trickle procedure described in
        <xref target="half-trickle"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Prior to sending an initial offer, agents using signaling protocols
        that support capabilities discovery can attempt to verify whether or 
        not the remote party supports Trickle ICE. If an agent determines 
        that the remote party does not support Trickle ICE, it MUST fall back 
        to using Vanilla ICE or abandon the entire session.
      </t>
      <t>
        In application protocols that use SDP, a user agent supporting 
        Trickle ICE MUST include a token of "trickle" in the 
        ice-options attribute every time it generates an offer or an answer. 
        This enables an agent that receives offers or answers to verify 
        support by checking for presence of the token. 
      </t>
      <t>
        Dedicated discovery semantics and half trickle are needed
        only prior to session initiation (e.g., 
        when sending the initial offer). After a session is established
        and Trickle ICE support is confirmed for both parties, either
        agent can use full trickle for subsequent offers.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Sending the Initial Offer' anchor="initial-offer">
      <t>
        An agent starts gathering candidates as soon as it has an
        indication that communication is imminent (e.g., a user interface
        cue or an explicit request to initiate a session). Contrary to
        Vanilla ICE, implementations of Trickle ICE do not need to
        gather candidates in a blocking manner. Therefore, unless half
        trickle is being used, agents SHOULD generate and transmit their
        initial offer as early as possible, in order to allow the remote
        party to start gathering and trickling candidates.
      </t>
      <t>
        Trickle ICE agents MAY include any set of candidates in an
        offer. This includes the possibility of sending an offer that 
        contains all the candidates that the agent plans to use
        (as in half trickle mode), sending an offer that contains only a 
        publically-reachable IP address (e.g., a host candidate at a media 
        relay that is known to not be behind a firewall), or sending an offer 
        with no candidates at all (in which case the offerer can receive the 
        answerer's initial candidate list sooner and the answerer can begin 
        candidate gathering more quickly).
      </t>
      <t>
        For optimal performance, it is RECOMMENDED that the candidates in
        an initial offer (if any) be host candidates only. This would allow 
        both agents to start gathering server reflexive, relayed, and other 
        non-host candidates simultaneously, and it would also enable them to
        begin connectivity checks.
      </t>
      <t>
        If the privacy implications of revealing host addresses on an
        endpoint device are a
        concern, agents can generate an offer that contains no
        candidates and then only trickle candidates that do not reveal
        host addresses (e.g., relayed candidates).
      </t>
      <t>
        Methods for calculating priorities and foundations, as well as 
        determining redundancy of candidates, work just as with vanilla
        ICE.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Receiving the Initial Offer' >
      <t>
        When an agent receives an initial offer, it will first check if
        the offer or offerer indicates support for Trickle ICE as explained in
        <xref target="disco"/>. If this is not the case, the agent MUST
        process the offer according to Vanilla ICE procedures 
        <xref target="rfc5245bis"/> or offer/answer processing rules
        <xref target="RFC3264"/> if no ICE support is detected at all.
      </t>
      <t>
        If support for Trickle ICE is
        confirmed, an agent will automatically assume support for
        Vanilla ICE as well even if the support verification procedure
        in <xref target="rfc5245bis"/> indicates otherwise. Specifically, 
        the rules from <xref target="rfc5245bis"/> would imply that ICE 
        itself is not supported if the initial offer includes no candidates 
        in the offer; however, such a conclusion is not warranted if the 
        answerer can confirm that the offerer supports Trickle ICE and 
        thus fallback to <xref target="RFC3264"/> is not necessary.
      </t>
      <t>
        If the offer does indicate support for Trickle ICE, the agent
        will determine its role, start gathering and prioritizing
        candidates and while doing so it will also respond by sending
        its own answer, so that both agents can start forming check
        lists and begin connectivity checks.
      </t>
      <section title="Sending the Initial Answer">
        <t>
          An agent can respond to an initial offer at any point while
          gathering candidates. The answer can again contain any set of
          candidates, including all candidates or no candidates. (The
          benefit of including no candidates is to send the answer as 
          quickly as possible, so that both parties can consider the 
          overall session to be under active negotiation as soon as 
          possible.) Unless the answering agent is
          protecting host addresses for privacy reasons, it would
          typically construct this initial answer including only host
          addresses, thus enabling the remote party to also start forming
          check lists and performing connectivity checks.
        </t>
        <t>
          In application protocols that use SDP, 
          the answer MUST indicate support for Trickle ICE as described
          in <xref target="disco"/>.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Forming Check Lists and Beginning Connectivity
                      Checks" anchor="check.lists">
        <t>
          After exchanging the offer and answer, and as soon as they have
          obtained local and remote candidates, agents begin
          forming candidate pairs, computing candidate pair priorities
          and ordering candidate pairs, pruning duplicate pairs, and
          creating check lists according to the Vanilla ICE procedures
          described in <xref target="rfc5245bis"/>. 
        </t>
        <t>
          According to those procedures, in order for candidate pairing 
          to be possible and for duplicate candidates to be pruned, the 
          candidates would need to be provided in both the offer and the 
          answer. Under Trickle ICE, check lists can be empty until 
          candidate pairs are sent or received. Therefore Trickle ICE agents 
          handle check lists and candidate pairing in a slightly different
          way: the agents still create the check lists, but they only 
          populate the check lists after they actually have the candidate 
          pairs.
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style='empty'>
            <t>
          Note: According to <xref target="rfc5245bis"/>, "A check list with at 
          least one pair that is Waiting is called an active check list, 
          and a check list with all pairs Frozen is called a frozen check list." 
          Formally speaking an active check list does not have a state of Active
          and a frozen check list does not have a state of Frozen, because the
          only check list states are Running, Completed, and Failed.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          A Trickle ICE agent MUST initially consider all check lists to be
          frozen.  It then inspects the first check list and
          attempts to unfreeze all candidates belonging to the first
          component on the first media stream (i.e., the first media
          stream that was reported to the ICE implementation from the
          using application). However, if this check list is still empty,
          an agent delays further processing until the check list is
          non-empty.
        </t>
        <t>
          With regard to pruning of duplicate candidate pairs, a Trickle ICE
          agent SHOULD follow a policy of "first one wins" and not re-apply 
          the pruning procedure if a higher-priority candidate pair is 
          received from the remote agent.
        </t>
        <t>
          Respecting the order in which check lists have been reported to an
          ICE implementation is crucial to the frozen candidates
          algorithm, so that connectivity
          checks are performed simultaneously by both agents.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Receiving the Initial Answer">
      <t>
        When receiving an answer, agents follow Vanilla ICE
        procedures to determine their role, after which they
        form check lists (as described in <xref target="check.lists"/>)
        and begin connectivity checks.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Performing Connectivity Checks' >
      <t>
        For the most part, Trickle ICE agents perform connectivity
        checks following Vanilla ICE procedures. However, the
        asynchronous nature of gathering and communicating candidates 
        in Trickle ICE impose a number of changes described as
        described in the following sections.
      </t>
      <section title="Scheduling Checks" anchor="scheduling-checks">
        <t>
          The ICE specification <xref target='rfc5245bis'/>, Section 5.8, 
          requires that agents terminate the timer for a triggered 
          check in relation to an active check list once the agent
          has exhausted all frozen pairs in check list.  This will
          not work with Trickle ICE, because more pairs will be
          added to the check list incrementally.
        </t>
        <t>
          Therefore, a Trickle ICE agent SHOULD NOT terminate the timer
          until the state of the check list is Completed or Failed as 
          specified herein (see <xref target='end-of-candidates'/>).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Check List and Timer State Updates"
               anchor="state-updates">
        <t>
          The ICE specification <xref target='rfc5245bis'/>, Section 7.1.3.3, 
          requires that agents update check lists and timer states upon 
          completing a connectivity check transaction. During such an 
          update, Vanilla ICE agents would set the state of a check list 
          to Failed if both of the following two conditions are satisfied:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">

              all of the pairs in the check list are either in the

        <t>
          With Trickle ICE, the above situation would often occur when
          candidate gathering and trickling are still in progress, even
          though it is quite possible that future checks will succeed. For
          this reason, Trickle ICE agents add the following conditions to
          the above list:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              all candidate gatherers have completed and the agent
              is not expecting to discover any new local candidates;
            </t>
            <t>
              the remote agent has sent an end-of-candidates indication
              for that check list as described in
              <xref target="end-of-candidates"/>.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          Vanilla ICE requires that agents then update all other check
          lists, placing one pair from each of them into the Waiting
          state, effectively unfreezing all remaining check lists. However,
          under Trickle ICE other check lists might still be empty at
          that point. Therefore a Trickle ICE agent SHOULD monitor whether 
          a check list is active or frozen independently of the state of the 
          candidate pairs that the check list contains. A Trickle ICE agent
          SHOULD consider a check list to be active either when unfreezing 
          the first candidate pair in the check list or when there is no
          candidate pair in the check list (i.e., when the check list is 
          empty).

    <section title='Discovering and Sending Additional Local Candidates'
             anchor="send-trickling">
      <t>
        After an offer or an answer has been sent, agents will most
        likely continue discovering new local candidates as STUN, TURN,
        and other non-host candidate gathering mechanisms begin to
        yield results. Whenever an agent discovers such a new candidate
        it will compute its priority, type, foundation and component ID
        according to normal Vanilla ICE procedures.
      </t>
      <t>
        The new candidate is then checked for redundancy against the
        existing list of local candidates. If its transport address and
        base match those of an existing candidate, it will be considered
        redundant and will be ignored. This would often happen for
        server reflexive candidates that match the host addresses they
        were obtained from (e.g., when the latter are public IPv4
        addresses). Contrary to Vanilla ICE, Trickle ICE agents will
        consider the new candidate redundant regardless of its priority.
      </t>
      <t>
        Next the agent sends (i.e., trickles) the newly discovered
        candidate(s) to the remote agent. The actual delivery of the new
        candidates are specified by using protocols such as SIP or XMPP.
        Trickle ICE imposes no restrictions on the way this is done or
        whether it is done at all. For example, some applications may
        choose not to send trickle updates for server reflexive
        candidates and rely on the discovery of peer reflexive ones
        instead.
      </t>
      <t>
        When trickle updates are sent, each candidate MUST be
        delivered to the receiving Trickle ICE implementation not more
        than once and in the same order that they were sent. In other
        words, if there are any candidate retransmissions, they must
        be hidden from the ICE implementation.
      </t>
      <t>
        Also, candidate trickling needs to be correlated to a specific
        ICE negotiation session, so that if there is an ICE restart, any
        delayed updates for a previous session can be recognized as such
        and ignored by the receiving party.
      </t>
      <t>
        One important aspect of Vanilla ICE is that connectivity checks
        for a specific foundation and component are attempted
        simultaneously by both agents, so that any firewalls or NATs
        fronting the agents would whitelist both endpoints and allow
        all except for the first ("suicide") packets to go through. This
        is also crucial to unfreezing candidates in the right time.
      </t>
      <t>
        In order to preserve this feature in Trickle ICE, when trickling
        candidates agents MUST respect the order of the components as
        they appear (implicitly or explicitly) in the offer/answer
        descriptions. Therefore a candidate for a specific component
        MUST NOT be sent prior to candidates for other components within
        the same foundation.
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, the following SDP description contains two
        components (RTP and RTCP) and two foundations (host and 
        server reflexive):

        For this description the RTCP host candidate MUST NOT be sent
        prior to the RTP host candidate. Similarly the RTP server
        reflexive candidate MUST be sent together with or prior to the
        RTCP server reflexive candidate.
      </t>
      <t>
        Note that the order restriction only applies among candidates
        that belong to the same foundation.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is also equally important to preserve this order across media
        streams, which is covered by the requirement to always start
        unfreezing candidates starting from the first media stream
        as described under <xref target="check.lists"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Once the candidate has been sent to the remote party, the agent
        checks if any remote candidates are currently known for this
        same stream. If not, the new candidate will
        simply be added to the list of local candidates.
      </t>
      <t>
        Otherwise, if the agent has already learned of one or more
        remote candidates for this stream and component, it will begin
        pairing the new local candidates with them and adding the pairs
        to the existing check lists according to their priority.
      </t>
      <section title='Pairing Newly Learned Candidates and Updating
                      Check Lists' anchor="cand-pairing">
        <t>
          Forming candidate pairs works the way it is described by
          the ICE specification <xref target='rfc5245bis'/>. 
          However, actually adding the new pair to
          a check list happens according to the rules
          described below.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the check list where the pair is to be added already
          contains the maximum number of candidate pairs (100 by default
          as per <xref target="rfc5245bis"/>), the new pair is discarded.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the new pair's local candidate is server reflexive, the
          server reflexive candidate MUST be replaced by its base before
          adding the pair to the list. Once this is done, the agent
          examines the check list looking for another pair that would be
          redundant with the new one. If such a pair exists, the newly
          formed pair is ignored.
        </t>
        <t>
          For all other pairs, including those with a server reflexive
          local candidate that were not found to be redundant:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              if this check list is frozen then the new pair will
              be assigned a state of Frozen.

            <t>
              else if the check list is active and it is either empty or
              contains only candidates in the Succeeded and Failed

            </t>
            <t>
              else if the check list is non-empty and active, then the

             anchor="end-of-candidates">
      <t>
        Once all candidate gathering is completed or expires for a 
        specific media stream, the agents will generate an
        "end-of-candidates" indication for that stream and send it to
        the remote agent via the signalling channel. The exact form of
        the indication depends on the application protocol. The
        indication can be sent in the following ways:
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>As part of an offer (which would typically be the case with 
             half trickle initial offers)</t>
          <t>Along with the last candidate an agent can send for a stream</t>
          <t>As a standalone notification (e.g., after STUN Binding requests 
             or TURN Allocate requests to a server timeout and the agent has 
             no other active gatherers)</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        A controlled Trickle ICE agent SHOULD send
        end-of-candidates indications after gathering for a media stream
        has completed, unless ICE processing terminates before the agent has
        had a chance to do so. Sending the indication is necessary in
        order to avoid ambiguities and speed up the conclusion of ICE 
        processing. On the other hand, a 
        controlling agent MAY 
        conclude ICE processing prior to sending end-of-candidates
        indications for all streams. This would typically be the case
        with aggressive nomination. However, it is RECOMMENDED that
        controlling agents do send such indications whenever possible
        for the sake of consistency and to keep middle boxes and
        controlled agents up-to-date on the state of ICE processing.
      </t>
      <t>
        When sending an end-of-candidate indication during trickling
        (rather than as a part of an offer or an answer), 
        it is the responsibility of the
        using protocol to define methods for relating the
        indication to one or more specific media streams.
      </t>
      <t>
        Receiving an end-of-candidates indication enables an agent to
        update check list states and, in case valid pairs do not exist
        for every component in every media stream, determine that ICE
        processing has failed. It also enables agents to speed up the
        conclusion of ICE processing when a candidate pair has been validated
        but it involves the use of lower-preference transports such as
        TURN. In such situations, an implementations may choose to wait
        and see if higher-priority candidates are received; in this case
        the end-of-candidates indication provides a notificaiton that such
        candidates are not forthcoming.
      </t>
      <t>
        An agent MAY also choose to generate an end-of-candidates
        indication before candidate gathering has actually completed, if the
        agent determines that gathering has continued for more than an
        acceptable period of time. However, an agent MUST NOT send any
        more candidates after it has send an end-of-candidates
        indication.
      </t>
      <t>
        When performing half trickle, an agent SHOULD send an
        end-of-candidates indication together with its initial offer unless
        it is planning to potentially send additional candidates (e.g., in
        case the remote party turns out to support Trickle ICE).
      </t>
      <t>
        When an end-of-candidates indication is sent as part of an offer or 
        an answer, it can be considered to apply to the session as a whole, 
        which is equivalent to having it apply to all media streams.
      </t>
      <t>
        After an agent sends the end-of-candidates indication, it will
        update the state of the corresponding check list as explained
        in <xref target="state-updates"/>. Past that point, an
        agent MUST NOT send any new candidates within this ICE session. 
        After an agent has received an end-of-candidates indication, it 
        MUST also ignore any newly received candidates for that media 
        stream or media session. Therefore, adding new candidates to the 
        negotiation is possible only through an ICE restart.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification does not
        override Vanilla ICE semantics for concluding ICE processing.
        Therefore even if end-of-candidates indications are sent
        agents will still have to go through pair nomination. Also, if
        pairs have been nominated for components and media streams, ICE
        processing will still conclude even if end-of-candidate
        indications have not been received for all streams.

        At any point of ICE processing, a Trickle ICE agent may receive
        new candidates from the remote agent. When this happens and no

        new remote candidates are simply added to the list of remote
        candidates.
      </t>

        Otherwise, the new candidates are used for forming candidate
        pairs with the pool of local candidates and they are added to

      </t>
      <t>
        Once the remote agent has completed candidate gathering, it
        will send an end-of-candidates indication. Upon receiving such an
        indication, the local agent MUST update check list states as per

      <t>
        Even though Trickle ICE does not explicitly modify the
        procedures for handling peer reflexive candidates, their
        processing could be impacted in implementations. With Trickle
        ICE, it is possible that server reflexive candidates can be
        discovered as peer reflexive in cases where incoming
        connectivity checks are received from these candidates before
        the trickle updates that carry them.
      </t>
      <t>
        While this would certainly increase the number of cases where
        ICE processing nominates and selects candidates discovered as
        peer-reflexive, it does not require any change in processing.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is also likely that some applications would prefer not to
        trickle server reflexive candidates to entities that are known
        to be publicly accessible and where sending a direct STUN

      <t>
        In half trickle mode, the offerer sends a regular, Vanilla ICE 
        offer, with a complete set of candidates. This ensures that the
        offer can be processed by a Vanilla ICE answerer and is mostly
        meant for use in cases where support for Trickle ICE cannot be 
        confirmed prior to sending an initial offer.  The initial offer 
        indicates support for Trickle ICE, so that the answerer can
        respond with an incomplete set of candidates and continue 
        trickling the rest.  Half trickle offers typically contain an
        end-of-candidates indication, although this is not mandatory
        because if trickle support is confirmed then the offerer can
        choose to trickle additional candidates before it sends an
        end-of-candidates indication.
      </t>
      <t>
        The half trickle mechanism can be used in cases where there is
        no way for an agent to verify in advance whether a remote
        party supports Trickle ICE. Because the initial offer contains 
        a full set of candidates, it can thus be handled by a regular
        Vanilla ICE agent, while still allowing a Trickle ICE agent to use
        the optimization defined in this specification. This prevents
        negotiation from failing in the former case while still giving
        roughly half the Trickle ICE benefits in the latter (hence the
        name of the mechanism).
      </t>
      <t>
        Use of half trickle is only necessary during an initial
        offer/answer exchange. After both parties have received a
        session description from their peer, they can each reliably
        determine Trickle ICE support and use it for all subsequent
        offer/answer exchanges.
      </t>
      <t>
        In some instances, using half trickle might bring more than 
        just half the improvement in terms of user experience. This 
        can happen when an agent starts gathering candidates upon user 
        interface cues that the user will soon be initiating an offer, 
        such as activity on a keypad or the phone going off hook. This 
        would mean that some or all of the candidate
        gathering could be completed before the agent actually
        needs to send the offer. Because the answerer will be able
        to trickle candidates, both agents will be able to start
        connectivity checks and complete ICE processing earlier than
        with Vanilla ICE and potentially even as early as with full
        trickle.
      </t>
      <t>
        However, such anticipation is not always possible. For
        example, a multipurpose user agent or a WebRTC web page where
        communication is a non-central feature (e.g., calling a support
        line in case of a problem with the main features) would not
        necessarily have a way of distinguishing between call
        intentions and other user activity. In such cases, using full
        trickle is most likely to result in an ideal user experience.
        Even so, using half trickle would be an improvement over vanilla
        ICE because it would result in a better experience for answerers.

    <section title='Interaction with ICE'
             anchor='interaction'>
      <t>
        The ICE protocol was designed to be flexible enough to
        work in and adapt to as many network environments as
        possible. Despite that flexibility, ICE as specified in
        <xref target="rfc5245bis"/> does not by itself support trickle 
        ICE. This section describes how trickling of candidates 
        interacts with ICE.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="rfc5245bis"/> describes the conditions required to
        update check lists and timer states while an ICE agent is in the
        Running state. These conditions are verified upon transaction
        completion and one of them stipulates that:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='empty'>
          <t>
            If there is not a pair in the valid list for each component
            of the media stream, the state of the check list is set to
            Failed.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        This could be a problem and cause ICE processing to fail
        prematurely in a number of scenarios. Consider the following
        case:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>
            Alice and Bob are both located in different networks with
            Network Address Translation (NAT). Alice and Bob themselves
            have different address but both networks use the same
            <xref target="RFC1918"/> block.
          </t>
          <t>
            Alice sends Bob the candidate 10.0.0.10 which also happens
            to correspond to an existing host on Bob's network.
          </t>
          <t>
            Bob creates a check list consisting solely of 10.0.0.10 and
            starts checks.
          </t>
          <t>
            These checks reach the host at 10.0.0.10 in Bob's network,
            which responds with an ICMP "port unreachable" error and per
            <xref target="rfc5245bis"/> Bob marks the transaction as
            Failed.
          </t>
        </list>
        At this point the check list only contains Failed candidates and
        the valid list is empty. This causes the media stream and
        potentially all ICE processing to Fail.
      </t>
      <t>
        A similar race condition would occur if the initial offer from
        Alice only contains candidates that can be determined as
        unreachable (per
        <xref target="I-D.keranen-mmusic-ice-address-selection"/>) from
        any of the candidates that Bob has gathered. This would be the
        case if Bob's candidates only contain IPv4 addresses and the
        first candidate that he receives from Alice is an IPv6 one.
      </t>
      <t>
        Another potential problem could arise when a non-trickle
        ICE implementation sends an offer to a trickle one. Consider the
        following case:
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>
            Alice's client has a non-Trickle ICE implementation
          </t>
          <t>
            Bob's client has support for Trickle ICE.
          </t>
          <t>
            Alice and Bob are behind NATs with address-dependent
            filtering <xref target="RFC4787"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
            Bob has two STUN servers but one of them is currently
            unreachable
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        After Bob's agent receives Alice's offer it would immediately
        start connectivity checks. It would also start gathering
        candidates, which would take a long time because of the unreachable
        STUN server. By the time Bob's answer is ready and sent to
        Alice, Bob's connectivity checks may well have failed: until
        Alice gets Bob's answer, she won't be able to start connectivity
        checks and punch holes in her NAT. The NAT would hence be
        filtering Bob's checks as originating from an unknown endpoint.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Interaction with ICE Lite'>
      <t>
        The behavior of ICE lite agents that are capable of Trickle ICE does not
        require any particular rules other than those already defined
        in this specification and <xref target="rfc5245bis"/>. This section
        is hence provided only for informational purposes.
      </t>
      <t>
        Such an agent would generate offers or
        answers as per <xref target="rfc5245bis"/>. Both its offers and 
        answers will indicate support for Trickle ICE. Given
        that they will contain a complete set of candidates (the agent's
        host candidates), these offers and answers would also be
        accompanied with an end-of-candidates indication.
      </t>
      <t>
        When performing full trickle, a full ICE implementation could
        send an offer or an answer with no candidates. After receiving 
        an answer that
        identifies the remote agent as an ICE lite implementation, the
        offerer may choose to not send any additional
        candidates. The same is also true in the case when the ICE lite
        agent is making the offer and the full ICE one is answering. In
        these cases the connectivity checks would be enough for the ICE
        lite implementation to discover all potentially useful
        candidates as peer reflexive. The following example illustrates
        one such ICE session using SDP syntax:

        In addition to reducing signaling traffic this approach also
        removes the need to discover STUN bindings, or to make TURN or

              cands received after end-of-cands. Solution: ignore, do
              an ICE restart if you want to add something.
            </t>
            <t>
              Added more terminology, including trickling, trickled
              candidates, half trickle, full trickle,
            </t>
            <t>
              Added a reference to the SIP usage for Trickle ICE as
              requested at the Boston interim.

              Brought back explicit use of Offer/Answer. There are no
              more attempts to try to do this in an O/A independent way.
              Also removed the use of ICE Descriptions.
            </t>
            <t>
              Added SDP specification for trickled candidates, the
              trickle option and 0.0.0.0 addresses in m-lines, and
              end-of-candidates.

              Support and Discovery. Changed that section to be less
              abstract. As discussed in IETF85, the draft now says
              implementations and usages need to either determine
              support in advance and directly use trickle, or do
              half trickle. Removed suggestion about use of discovery in
              SIP or about letting implementing protocols do what they
              want.
            </t>
            <t>
              Defined Half Trickle. Added a section that says how it
              works. Mentioned that it only needs to happen in the first
              o/a (not necessary in updates), and added Jonathan's
              comment about how it could, in some cases, offer more than
              half the improvement if you can pre-gather part or all of
              your candidates before the user actually presses the call
              button.
            </t>
            <t>
              Added a short section about subsequent offer/answer
              exchanges.
            </t>
            <t>
              Added a short section about interactions with ICE Lite
              implementations.
            </t>
            <t>
              Added two new entries to the open issues section.

              Relaxed requirements about verifying support following
              a discussion on MMUSIC.
            </t>
            <t>
              Introduced ICE descriptions in order to remove ambiguous
              use of 3264 language and inappropriate references to
              offers and answers.
            </t>
            <t>
              Removed inappropriate assumption of adoption by RTCWEB
              pointed out by Martin Thomson.
